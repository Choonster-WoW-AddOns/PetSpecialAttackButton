Overview
--------
Pet Special Attack Button is a WoW AddOn that allows you to use `/click PetSpecialAttackButton` in macros to use the special ability of your current pet. It should work with Stampede.

Installation
------------
This AddOn is available from Curse and WoW Interface. The source code is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Choonster/PetSpecialAttackButton).

To install, move the `PetSpecialAttackButton` folder containing this file to your `WoW\Interface\AddOns` folder and restart WoW if it was open.

Non-English Locales
-------------------
To generate the abilities file for your locale, you'll need to use the included `generate_abilities.lua` script.

This requires an installation of Lua with several libraries, as detailed at the start of the script.

Before running the script, you'll need to change the configuration variables at the start of it; which is best done in a text editor with syntax highlighting.
There are several editor recommendations on this page:
